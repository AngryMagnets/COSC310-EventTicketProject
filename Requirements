Your functional requirements (what will the system do to support users)
For Host:
The system provides spaces for all relevant information for an event to be added.
The system allows the host to update/ edit/ cancel events as needed. 
When an event is created, it is given a specific/ unique reference code. This will be used to code tickets purchased as well. 
For Attendee (also includes host as an attendee):
The system allows users to search for events based on specified criteria indicated by the host (genre, date, cost etc).
The user can view an event before purchasing a ticket to it.
The user will be able to purchase a ticket to any event. 
The system only allows the user to buy tickets to one event at a time.(ie there is no cart).
Each ticket will be assigned a specific registration code based off of the event code. 
For Admin:
The admin will have a special page for approving or declining venues and events.
The approval requests will be in a list. They can click on the name to see more information then approve or decline.
Declined events will move to the “declined events list”

Your non-functional requirements.  
Product Requirements:
Purchasing a ticket should be doable in under a minute.
Open website > click purchase ticket on an event > checkout.
Our goal would be for the system to be usable for all users. This would be achieved through talk to text, voice recognition software and/or otherwise. However in the interest of this project and time constraints, this will be added if time allows. 


Organizational Requirements:
Follow all guidelines for online security and protection of user privacy as outlined by:
Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA):
https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96165_00
Personal Information Protection and Electronics Documents Act (PIPA):
https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/03063_01
All ticketing will be done virtually to limit paper use/ waste. 


External Requirements:
If a user is not willing to share their name and email address when purchasing a ticket, they cannot purchase a ticket. 
The system must keep confidential information confidential. 
Includes all user information on file, and any information that is needed to be shared will be approved by the user. (see next point)
Any user information that is to be shared for ticket validation etc is to be approved by the user. 
If a users email, name, ticket number is to be shared with an event for any reason, the user has to approve it. 
This will likely be a box that is clicked when purchasing the ticket. 
Our system simply accepts payment and does not have access to users’ personal banking accounts.
